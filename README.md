## What I Learned  
This project helped me improve my **responsive design** skills and reinforced my ability to create **mobile-first** layouts using **CSS**. I learned how to style components efficiently, focusing on **typography**, **spacing**, and **flexbox** to achieve a clean and modern card design.

## Ongoing Development  
I plan to refine the card’s design by experimenting with more **interactive elements**, such as **hover effects** and **CSS animations**. Additionally, I will continue improving accessibility and ensuring that the design works across all devices.
